Thanks to the many people who have contributed to this collection. I love collecting coins and if you are an enthusiast too, I'll gladly trade 

If you come across coins that you see no worth for in today's world, or that you do not know what to do with, it'll be my pleasure to relieve you of them :-)

And finally, the coins might be ordered in a haphazard manner below. That is because it is tabulated the way I have stored them in my collection.
Do note that their documentation is not complete. The images for my entire collection can be found here <a href='/static/img/blog/Numismatics/Indian Ancient Coins/'>here</a>
